    text: Using the roots of the tree, Tretogon began to suck out life energy from
      the earth, thereby making himself immortal and omnipotent. Together with his
      endless army and the power of the tree, Tretogon began to expand the territories
      of his rule, devastating more and more lands and killing all those who opposed
      him.

      for Tretogon's empires.

    text: 'For many years he served in Tretogon''s army, exterminating all recalcitrant
      people who tried to oppose the regime of empires. After countless battles,
      Gration has lost the meaning of life, becoming an insensitive killing machine. '
